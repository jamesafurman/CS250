User needs must be fundamentally understood as the value that will be provided to a program’s users. Their implementation depends on their specific nature, and in an individual program they often take the form of program features. User stories 1. serve as a basis for expressing the value of the user need’s implementation, 2. create shared knowledge in a development team about what the implementation must do, and why, and 3. allow developers to break down their project into memorable pieces, facilitating better conceptualization. <br />
I approach development in an empirical trial-and-error process, and I hope as I gain experience that I will learn to implement certain designs by rote, scaling up the predictable substance of my work, and therefore be able to incorporate work velocity estimates into my workflow. Being a good team member consists in two aspects: being competent and being communicative. A basis of technical competence is needed to actually accomplish anything as a developer, but for a team to work as a team there must be an ongoing deposit of shared knowledge; maintaining appropriate communication is needed for everyone to really know where their project stands.
